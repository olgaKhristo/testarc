## Project Overview

Before continuing to develop my project, I plan to implement testing strategies first. For example, using Jest for unit testing would be a good idea to ensure that everything is working as expected. Following a test-driven development approach would help maintain code quality and prevent potential issues in the future.

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

Setting up my MVP as a foundation, I would focus on improving the user experience by adding a calendar and an option to look for events on a specific date. Additionally, enhancing the user interface with more CSS code to create an appealing design is a priority. While doing so, I will ensure to consider accessibility guidelines and make color choices thoughtfully. Tools like Lighthouse will be used to verify that the application meets industry standards for performance and accessibility.

### TypeScript

Considering that this is a React project, using TypeScript instead of JavaScript would be a great idea to avoid handling errors as the project grows. TypeScript provides static typing, which helps catch errors during development and enhances code maintainability.

### User-Centered Development

To develop a better concept and understanding of how to improve the project and add more functionality, I plan to create user stories and personas. Understanding users needs will guide me in making informed design and development decisions. Additionally, starting with a low-fidelity wireframe will provide a clear vision of the application's structure and layout.

By following these strategies and best practices, I aim to build a robust and user-friendly application that delivers a great experience to its users.
